gae-gcs-push2deploy-secrets
===========================

Sample to show how to keep your secrets secret while having your Google App Engine projects open-sourced and connected to GitHub for Push-to-deploy.

For this sample to work you need to create an OAuth Client ID in the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/), download the JSON file and upload it as `client_secret.json` to the Google Cloud Storage default bucket of your project.
